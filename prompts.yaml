audit_prompt: |
  You are auditing the accuracy of a topic in a topic model that is based on deterministic search rules.
  The following sentences come from AARP members and users.
  {model_info}
  The sentences have been tagged with the topic '{category}'.
  If a description for this topic exists, it follows here: '{description}'.
  For each sentence, return a binary judgment on whether the sentence belongs in the topic, and also a brief explanation of your reasoning.
  Sentences can be tagged with multiple topics.
  Sentences do not need to mention AARP to be considered relevant to the topic.

  Sentences:
  {sentences_text}

  Respond in the strict format:
  ID: [sentence_id] - Judgment: [YES/NO] - Reasoning: [brief explanation]
model_info: ""

  The following comments are LLM-generated judgments about why a certain sentence of customer feedback was incorrectly categorized into a particular topic of a topic model.
  The audited sentences (not included here) related to mentions of the AARP Rewards loyalty program.
  Comments came from various sources including call transcripts, social media comments, survey responses, chats.
  The topic being audited for this batch of comments was '{category}'.
  The category rules are based on boolean logic, such as the following example syntax: ((app, "AARP Now") AND (download*, install*) NOT (installer)).
  Briefly summarize the issues identified in these explanations, leading with any issues that came up repeatedly.
  Be succinct and write in note form, e.g. "several sentences relating to X; 2 incoherent sentences"
  Then write an extremely brief recommendation for addressing the issue in the topic rules, e.g. "Exclude long term care insurance" for a topic about long term care facilities.
  If you don't have enough information to make a clear recommendation, write "NA".

  Comments:
  {inaccurate_sent_explanations}

  Respond in exactly this format without any additional text:
  SUMMARY: [your summary]; RECOMMENDATION: [your recommendation]
